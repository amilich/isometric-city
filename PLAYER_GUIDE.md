## Building Catalog

### Service Buildings
Service buildings provide essential coverage to your city. They function based on a **radius** system.

| Building | Cost | Size | Range (Tiles) | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Police Station** | $500 | 1x1 | 13 | Reduces crime and increases safety. |
| **Fire Station** | $500 | 1x1 | 18 | Extinguishes fires and prevents them from starting. |

| **Hospital** | $1,000 | 2x2 | 12 | Improves public health. |

### Infrastructure & Utilities
Utilities in IsoCity are broadcast wirelessly within a specific radius. You do not need to lay power lines or pipes.

| Building | Cost | Size | Range (Tiles) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Power Plant** | $3,000 | 2x2 | 15 | Generates electricity. Essential for most buildings to function. |
| **Water Tower** | $1,000 | 1x1 | 12 | Provides water. Essential for building growth. |
| **Road** | $25 | 1x1 | - | Connects zones. Zones must be within **8 tiles** of a road (connected by other zone tiles) to develop. |
| **Rail** | $40 | 1x1 | - | Increases Commercial and Industrial demand. |
| **Rail Station** | $1,000 | 2x2 | - | Required to access the rail network. |
| **Subway** | $50 | 1x1 | - | Underground transit. Boosts commercial job density. |
| **Subway Station** | $750 | 1x1 | - | Provides access to the subway network. |
