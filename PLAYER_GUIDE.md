## Building Catalog

### Service Buildings
Service buildings provide essential coverage to your city. They function based on a **radius** system.

| **Police Station** | $500 | 1x1 | 13 | Reduces crime, Safety +15% locally. |
| **Fire Station** | $500 | 1x1 | 18 | Extinguishes fires, Safety +10% locally. |
| **School** | $400 | 2x2 | 11 | Basic Education. Land Value +15. |
| **University** | $2,000 | 3x3 | 19 | Advanced Education. Land Value +35. |
| **Hospital** | $1,000 | 2x2 | 12 | Public Health. Land Value +25. |

### Infrastructure & Utilities
| Building | Cost | Size | Range | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Power Plant** | $3,000 | 2x2 | 15 | Generates power. High Pollution (+30). Lowers Land Value (-20). |
| **Water Tower** | $1,000 | 1x1 | 12 | Provides water. Neutral Land Value (+5). |
| **Road** | $25 | 1x1 | - | Necessary for development. Slight Pollution (+2). |
| **Rail** | $40 | 1x1 | - | Boosts Industry. High Pollution (+1), Lowers Land Value (-2). |
| **Rail Station** | $1,000 | 2x2 | - | Access to Rail. Land Value +20. |
| **Subway Station** | $750 | 1x1 | - | Access to Subway. Land Value +25. |

### Parks & Recreation
Parks provide happiness, reduce pollution, and significantly boost local Land Value.

| Building | Cost | Size | Land Value Effect | Pollution Reduction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Small Park** | $150 | 1x1 | +20 | -10 |
| **Large Park** | $600 | 3x3 | +50 | -25 |
| **Tennis Court** | $200 | 1x1 | +15 | -5 |
| **Basketball Court** | $250 | 1x1 | +12 | -3 |
| **Playground** | $200 | 1x1 | +15 | -5 |
| **Swimming Pool** | $450 | 1x1 | +18 | -5 |
| **Stadium** | $5,000 | 3x3 | +40 | - |

### Special Buildings
These unique structures provide massive city-wide bonuses and demand boosts.

| Building | Cost | Size | Jobs | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **City Hall** | $6,000 | 2x2 | 60 | **Global Demand Boost** (Res+8, Com+10, Ind+5). Land Value +50. |
| **Museum** | $4,000 | 3x3 | 40 | **Commercial Boost** (+15). Land Value +45. |
| **Airport** | $10,000 | 4x4 | 200 | **Major Commercial/Industrial Boost** (+15/+10). High Pollution (+20). |
| **Space Program** | $15,000 | 3x3 | 150 | **High-Tech Industry Boost** (+20). Massive Land Value (+80). |
| **Amusement Park** | $12,000 | 4x4 | 100 | **Commercial Demand Boost** (+18). Land Value +60. |

## Zoning & Growth Mechanics

### Densification (Levels)
In IsoCity, **Density** is represented by a building's **Level** (1-5).
-   **Level 1:** Low density (Small houses, small shops). Max Pop ~6.
-   **Level 3:** Medium density (Mansions, Offices). Max Pop ~18-90.
-   **Level 5:** High density (Skyscrapers, High-rises). Max Pop ~260+.

As a zone's **Land Value** and **Service Coverage** improve, existing buildings will automatically "level up," replacing their sprite with a larger, denser structure and increasing their population/job capacity.

### Zone Types
| Zone | Primary Purpose | Key Requirements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Residential** | Provides housing. | Road access, Power, Water, Low Pollution. |
| **Commercial** | Provides jobs/shopping. | Road access, Power, Water, Customers (Pop). |
| **Industrial** | Provides heavy jobs. | Road access, Power, Water, Rail/Airport connectivity. |

### Development Requirements
1.  **Road Access:** Within **8 tiles** of a road.
2.  **Utilities:** Power and Water required for Level 2+ growth.

### Abandonment & Recovery
-   **Abandonment:** Occurs when demand drops below **-20** (Oversupply) or age > 30.
-   **Recovery:** Abandoned buildings recover when demand rises above **+10`**.


## System Mechanics

Beyond zoning and building, several background systems simulate the life of your city.

### Land Value
Land Value determines the quality and density of development.
-   **Increases:** Proximity to water, trees, parks, and high-quality service coverage (Schools, Hospitals).
-   **Decreases:** High pollution (from factories and power plants) and proximity to heavy rail or roads.

### Traffic & Pollution
-   **Traffic:** Generated by residential, commercial, and industrial activity. High traffic slightly increases pollution and can lower land value in residential areas.
-   **Pollution:** Factories and Power Plants generate significant pollution. It spreads to neighboring tiles and negatively impacts health and land value. Trees and parks help mitigate local pollution.

### Safety & Health
-   **Safety:** Calculated from Police and Fire coverage. High safety prevents abandonment and encourages high-wealth residents.
-   **Health:** Influenced by Hospital coverage and environmental quality (low pollution). Higher health leads to a more productive workforce.

## Economy

Managing the city's budget is crucial for sustainable growth.

### Income
Your city generates revenue primarily through **Taxation**:
-   **Residential Taxes:** Based on total population.
-   **Business Taxes:** Based on total jobs in commercial and industrial zones.
-   **Base Rate:** The standard tax rate is **9%**. Raising taxes will increase immediate income but will eventually lower demand for all zones.

### Expenses
Maintaining services and infrastructure costs money every month:
-   **Service Maintenance:** Every Police Station, Fire Station, School, and Hospital has a monthly maintenance cost.
-   **Infrastructure:** Roads, Subway tracks, and Rail lines require constant upkeep.
-   **Funding Levels:** You can adjust funding for each department in the Budget panel. Lowering funding reduces service effectiveness (and coverage radius) but saves money.

### Demand
Demand is the "engine" of your city's growth. It is influenced by:
-   **Taxation:** High taxes crush demand.
-   **Employment:** High unemployment increases Residential demand (people seeking work) but lowers Commercial demand.
-   **Special Buildings:** Airports, Stadiums, and Space Programs provide massive boosts to specific demand types.
